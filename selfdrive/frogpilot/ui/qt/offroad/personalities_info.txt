Following Distance:
Represents the desired time-based distance from the lead vehicle in seconds. This value adjusts how closely openpilot follows the car in front. It is not an exact value but a more representative value.

Real-World Example: If this value is set to 1.5 seconds, and you’re driving at 50 mph (80 kph), openpilot aims to keep a distance of about 110 feet (33.5 meters) from the car in front. It means if the car in front suddenly stops, you have 1.5 seconds to react and stop safely.

Acceleration Jerk:
Controls how quickly the car speeds up or slows down.

Real-World Example: If you like your rides to be smooth and gentle, you can set this value higher. So, if the car in front speeds up or slows down suddenly, openpilot will change its speed more slowly to avoid jerky movements.

Danger Zone Jerk:
How careful the car is when it gets close to other cars or obstacles.

Real-World Example: If there’s a much slower car ahead of you, setting a higher danger zone will make openpilot more cautious. It will brake sooner and harder if the speed difference is big or the distance is small, making sure you don’t get too close too quickly.

Speed Control Jerk:
How smoothly the car changes its speed overall.

Real-World Example: If you set this value higher, openpilot will change the car's speed more gradually to adjust to higher/lower speed limits and other speed change conditions where there's no lead. So, when you need to speed up to match the set cruise speed or slow down because of traffic, openpilot will do it gently, making the ride smoother.

In Summary:

Following Distance: Sets how far to stay behind the car in front, based on time.
Acceleration Jerk: Controls how smoothly the car changes speed.
Danger Zone Jerk: Adjusts how cautious the car is when getting close to other cars or obstacles.
Speed Control Jerk: Controls the overall smoothness of speed changes when there's no lead in front.
